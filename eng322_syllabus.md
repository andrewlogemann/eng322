# About the Course
This course will provide an introduction to modern Irish Literature, beginning with the tremendous output of poetry, drama, fiction and prose during the Irish Literary Revival (the 1890s through the 1930s), and focusing on the influential work of W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, J. M. Synge and George Bernard Shaw. We will move next to the height of the modernist movement in Ireland, including the work of James Joyce and Samuel Beckett. The course will close with a discussion of Northern Ireland and the combination of politics and Christianity that has, until recently, been a source of tension and violence in the region.  Major themes will include the uniquely Irish sense of history, which includes the myth, legend, and folklore these writers put to intriguing uses; political issues such as colonialism, nationalism, and the Irish language; religious issues such as belief, despair, prayer, the figure of the priest; attitudes towards the Irish landscape, people, and culture; as well as more general modernist questions such as fragmentation, alienation, issues of gender/race/class, and the nature of the work of art.
